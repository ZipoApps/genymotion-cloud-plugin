# CatViewer
Example of creation plugin which use JCEF for IntelliJ. [Is part of blog post](https://medium.com/virtuslab/creating-intellij-plugin-with-webview-3b27c3f87aea).

## Build
You need JDK- I have tested with 15.
Later just:
```
./gradlew runIde
```
If you will try to run it some time after publish, bump versions of gradle, scala and others. Or use Java 15.
